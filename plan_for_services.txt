Visual and interaction concept
Grid of square tiles (aspect-square): icon + title centered.
Tap/click a tile → it expands in place to reveal 2–4 lines of context and a small inline link “לקביעת תור”.
Mobile-first: 1 column on small screens, then 2/3/4 on larger screens.
Light micro‑interaction: subtle shadow/scale on hover; smooth expand/collapse.
Theme: white tiles, soft shadow, accent colors you already use (#A27B5C, #859a85).
Why this approach
Minimal, fast, and accessible.
Matches RTL and your palette.
Avoids complex JS; keeps bundle small and layout stable.
Implementation plan (no code yet)
Content
Use existing services array.
For each service: show icon + title.
Expanded area: short description + 1–3 concise lines from longDescription.
Add small inline link: “לקביעת תור” → #קביעת-תור.
Markup
Replace the current tiles with native HTML details/summary per tile:
summary: icon + title (acts like a button).
Expanded content: short paragraph and bullets + tiny CTA link.
Each tile uses h3 for the title for SEO.
Styling (Tailwind utilities)
Grid: grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4.
Tile: details styled as a card: rounded-xl bg-white shadow-md p-6 transition hover:shadow-lg.
Square look: aspect-square for the closed state; when opened, it grows naturally.
Text/RTL: text-right, logical paddings, consistent icon sizing.
Interaction
Rely on <details>’ built-in toggle. It’s keyboard-accessible and screen‑reader friendly by default.
Add aria-expanded cosmetic class hooks if we need custom states (optional).
Smooth expand: transition opacity/transform for the inner content; avoid animating height directly.
Accessibility
summary is focusable and announces state.
h3 inside summary, label in Hebrew.
Ensure focus ring visible; no color-only indicators.
Performance
No extra deps.
Icons only (no new images).
Avoid expensive animations; just opacity/transform.
Keep content short to reduce layout shift when expanding.
SEO/LLM
Each card title in an h3.
Short, factual descriptions; avoid fluff.
On-page facts remain consistent with JSON‑LD.


EDITOR NOTES : 
 start implementation , (including generation of mockup text in the description)
do not Add small inline link: “לקביעת תור” → #קביעת-תור.
make sure the Smooth expand works
